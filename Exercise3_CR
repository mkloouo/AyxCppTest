    Issue: Function object reader.
    Proposed solution: Functions have to be actions, you might name it readDataPiece.
Line: 36
    Issue: Magical constant -1 shadowing real data, (there might be -1 in your data waiting to be read)
    Proposed solution: Think of another way of reading data pieces.
Line: 38
    Issue: Use of newline escape literal, out might be bufferized and your newline character may
    appear somewhere your really wouldn't thought it could.
    Proposed solution: Use std::endl I/O manipulator.

Overall:
    I think constructing Data object is pretty well clarifying whose reader it is. GetDataReader.
    Try to think of some other way for reading data. You might create inner reader class and give
    it to user.
